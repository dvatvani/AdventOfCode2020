# Advent of Code 2020

This are my solutions to the puzzles in [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/)

The solutions are written in Python and shared in the form of a Notebook. They can be found in the Notebooks folder of this repository.

Note that input data for the puzzles vary for each participant, so you'll have to obtain your own puzzle input files if you wish to use this code for your own entries.
